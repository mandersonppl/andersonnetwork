        <div class="background"> </div>    
        
        <p>We are a socially responsible parent company, designed to either operate a business solely 
            or alongside a business' creator(s) to maximize profits and enrich others' lives.</p>
        
        <p>The Anderson Network is run by Matt & Tiffany Anderson, a husband and wife duo, who 
            currently reside in Kentucky, just south of Louisville. They are part of a network of like-minded 
            individuals who are seeking financial independence and freedom from a nine-to-five.</p>
        
        <p>Tiffany started her career at a large printing company and then for a large pizza chain as a 
            member of their Accounting department, then on to the Marketing department. She has<br>
        over 10 years of experience in Marketing and Accounting, and is the Owner & CEO of<br> The Anderson Network. She is currently running Sensor Rich, which is a company under<br> The Anderson Network umbrella. Now that she is finally free of a nine-to-five, she is able<br> to pursue the business full-time.</p>
        
        <p>Previously, Matt served in the U.S. Army as an Infantryman from 2002 to 2006. After the<br> Army, he had a number of jobs ranging from assistant foreman of a machine shop to pest<br> control sales, and is currently a Profit Protection Auditor (past 10 years) for a large electronics<br> retailer. Currently, he is attending Capella University to pusue a Bachelors in Information<br> Technology. He would like to move in a website/software development direction to further<br> assist the company.</p>
        
        <p div class="vertical-container">The Anderson Network is an idea that has been in the back of our minds for many years.<br> There have been numerous attempts at different business models throughout our adult lives,<br> but all of our past stumbles, we feel, have been leading us up to this point. </p>
