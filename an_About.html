        <p>We are a happily-married couple, currently
        living just south of Louisville, KY.<br> Both of
        us have struggled with a number of mental illnesses
        in our adolescent<br> and adult lives and are
        advocates for others that identify with similar
        disorders.</p>
        
        <p>During the pandemic of 2020, and as people are now settling into a "new normal",<br> it has become
        prevalent that mental health issues are even more serious than<br> previously thought. While still 
        taboo, not being addressed properly, we hope that<br> we can make a difference in the lives of those 
        like us, donating a portion of the<br> proceeds to our favorite local and national organizations to 
        spread awareness.</p>
        
        <p><strong><em>Thanks for helping our efforts and supporting our business!</em></strong></p>
