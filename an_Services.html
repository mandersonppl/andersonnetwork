        <p> Do you or someone you know have trouble sitting still? Are they always doing something with their
        hands or seem "bored" within a few minutes of completing a task? Is someone you know on the autism
        spectrum (have sensory issues with light, sound, textures, etc.), maybe just sensetive to social situations
        or been classified as "awkward" by others?</p>
        
        <p> You should place our fidget poppers into these busy hands and see what the hype is all about! With this
        latest fidget "rage", we have sourced the highest quality producers of this silicone tool. They are
        designed to combat anxiety, boredom, stress and so many other issues that can lead to trouble in school,
        work or other social settings. The satisfying "pops" on each side keep kids of all ages engrossed and
        entertained for longer than most other noisy, aggravating, and non-engaging products.</p>
